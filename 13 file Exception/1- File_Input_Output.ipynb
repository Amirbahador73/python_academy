    "| **`fileno()`** |   Returns an integer number (file descriptor) of the file.   | \n",
    "| **`flush()`** |   Flushes the write buffer of the file stream.   | \n",
    "| **`isatty()`** |   Returns **`True`** if the file stream is interactive.   | \n",
    "| **`read(n)`** |   Reads at most `n` characters from the file. Reads till end of file if it is negative or `None`.   | \n",

    "| **`seekable()`** |   Returns **`True`** if the file stream supports random access.   | \n",
    "| **`tell()`** |   Returns the current file location.   | \n",
    "| **`truncate(size=None)`** |   Resizes the file stream to **`size`** bytes. If **`size`** is not specified, resizes to current location..   | \n",
    "| **`writable()`** |   Returns **`True`** if the file stream can be written to.   | \n",
    "| **`write(s)`** |   Writes the string **`s`** to the file and returns the number of characters written..   | \n",
